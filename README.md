# GUN-p2p #

### a p2p chat app running through the GUN protocol ###

GUN is a protocol meant to be used for decentralized webapps (or dapps) by using the magic of WebRTC,
utilizing a built in barebones limited graph style DB.
This is a work in progress, making a web-based anonymous chat app utilizing p2p communication, with persistance of data over the network.
As of now, the project is pretty barebones.
